# VideoToSlides
A quick python script which attempts to extract the slides from a video. This was made primarily because of professors who don't post slides for their lectures, yet just read directly from them in their lecture.

# Usage:
Usage is simple. Run python video_to_slide.py and pass in the proper arguments.
Argument 1 is name of the video file to convert. Argument 2 is the number of seconds between checking frames. Argument 3 is % threshold needed to trigger the addition.
The output is named out.pdf and is a slideshow of the images.
